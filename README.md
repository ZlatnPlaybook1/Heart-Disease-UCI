Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient medical attributes. Our objective is to build an effective predictive model that can support early diagnosis and treatment decisions.
üìå Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality globally. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention. Leveraging machine learning, we aim to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data, improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
üìä Dataset

We use the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes several medical features such as:

    Age

    Gender

    Chest pain type

    Resting blood pressure

    Serum cholesterol

    Fasting blood sugar

    Resting ECG results

    Maximum heart rate

    Exercise-induced angina

    ST depression

    Slope of ST segment

    Number of major vessels

    Thalassemia

The target variable indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
üéØ Problem Statement

To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on their medical features.
